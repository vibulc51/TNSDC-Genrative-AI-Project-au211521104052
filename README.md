# Loan Prediction using Deep Learning with ANN

This project aims to predict loan approval or rejection using deep learning techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

## Overview

The loan prediction model utilizes a dataset containing various features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, etc., to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected by a financial institution. The model is implemented using an Artificial Neural Network algorithm, which is a deep learning technique known for its ability to capture complex relationships in data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided in the `dataset.csv` file. It contains the following columns:

- ApplicantIncome: The applicant's income
- CoapplicantIncome: The co-applicant's income
- LoanAmount: The loan amount applied for
- Loan_Amount_Term: The term of the loan in months
- Credit_History: Credit history meets guidelines (1 for meeting guidelines, 0 for not meeting)
- Property_Area: The area where the property is located
- Loan_Status: The target variable indicating loan approval (1 for approved, 0 for not approved)

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-prediction-deep-learning.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd loan-prediction-deep-learning
```

2. Train the model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

3. Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by running:

```bash
python predict.py
```

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test dataset.
